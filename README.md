<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Social Media module is a Joomla extension designed to provide a responsive and customizable social media feed for a website. The module supports both Facebook and Instagram feeds, and allows the user to choose from various layouts, including default, masonry, widget, and carousel. The module features a range of configuration options that can be used to fine-tune the appearance and behavior of the feed, including the maximum number of items, media type, media layout, and access tokens. The module also includes a caching system for improving the performance of the website, as well as support for external CSS and JavaScript assets.

> I wanted to let you know that my module is currently not compatible with Joomla 4. As you may be aware, Joomla 4 will be adopted in the near future, and I am working on making my module compatible with this new version. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience as I work towards making my module fully functional with Joomla 4. In the meantime, I recommend using my module with Joomla 3 or earlier versions.

## Facebook API Access

To get a Facebook API access token, client ID, and secret, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Facebook Developer website and log in with your Facebook account.
2. Create a new Facebook app by clicking on the "My Apps" dropdown menu and selecting "Create App".
3. Choose the platform you'll be using the app for, such as "Web" or "iOS", and enter a name for your app.
4. On the dashboard for your new app, click on the "Add Product" button and select the product you want to use, such as "Facebook Login" or "Facebook Pages API".
5. Follow the setup instructions for the product you chose, which may include verifying your domain, adding Facebook Login to your website, or connecting a Facebook page.
6. Once you've completed the setup for your chosen product, you'll be able to access your app's "App ID" and "App Secret" on the app's dashboard under the "Settings" tab.
7. To get an access token for your app, you can use the Facebook Graph API Explorer tool. Log in with the same Facebook account you used to create your app, select your app from the dropdown menu, and generate an access token with the necessary permissions for your app's features.

Note that the process for obtaining an access token may vary depending on your app's requirements and the specific product you're using. Be sure to read the documentation and follow the instructions provided by Facebook to ensure that you're obtaining and using access tokens and other API credentials correctly.

## Instagram API Access

To obtain an Instagram API access token, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Instagram account, and make sure your account is a business or creator account. If you have a personal account, you will need to convert it to a business account. To do this, go to your profile settings and click "Switch to Professional Account."
2. Go to the Facebook Developer website and create a new app, or use an existing app that is associated with your Instagram account.
3. Once you have created your app, go to the app dashboard, and click on the "Instagram Basic Display" product.
4. Follow the setup instructions to configure your Instagram account for the app. This may include connecting your Instagram account to the app and submitting your app for Instagram review.
5. Once your app is approved by Instagram, you can generate an Instagram API access token from the app dashboard. To do this, go to the "Access Token" tab and click the "Generate Token" button.
6. Copy the access token, and use it in your application to make Instagram API requests.

Note that the process for obtaining an Instagram API access token may vary depending on your app's requirements and the specific Instagram product you're using. Be sure to read the documentation and follow the instructions provided by Facebook and Instagram to ensure that you're obtaining and using access tokens and other API credentials correctly.

## Troubleshooting

### Facebook API

**Facebook API feed posts are being skipped.**

There could be a few different reasons why your Facebook API feed posts are being skipped:

- Permissions: Make sure that your Facebook API access token has the necessary permissions to access the feed of the page you want to display. You may need to generate a new access token with the appropriate permissions.
- Privacy settings: If the posts in the feed have been set to a restricted privacy setting, they may not be accessible through the API. Make sure that the posts you want to display are set to a public privacy setting.
- Time range: By default, the Facebook API will only return posts from the past 30 days. If you're trying to display older posts, you may need to adjust the time range in your API request.
- API changes: Facebook regularly updates their API, so it's possible that changes to the API have affected the way your code interacts with it. Make sure you're using the latest version of the Facebook API and check for any updates to your code or the libraries you're using.

Errors in code: Double-check your code for any errors that might be causing the feed posts to be skipped. Make sure you're properly handling any errors returned by the API and that your code is correctly parsing the data returned by the API.

By addressing these possible issues, you may be able to resolve the problem of skipped feed posts in your Facebook API integration.

**Posts are not rendering.**

- Access token is invalid or expired: Facebook API requires an access token to fetch posts. If the token is invalid or expired, the API will not be able to fetch posts. To fix this, you need to generate a new access token and update it in the module's settings.

- The Facebook app is not approved: If you are using a Facebook app to access the API, it needs to be approved by Facebook. If it is not approved, the API will not be able to fetch posts. To fix this, you need to submit your app for approval to Facebook.
- The page or group is not public: If the page or group from which you want to fetch posts is not public, the API will not be able to fetch posts. You need to make sure that the page or group is public or you have the necessary permissions to access it.
- The user token does not have the required permissions: If you are using a user token to fetch posts, it needs to have the necessary permissions to access the page or group from which you want to fetch posts. If the token does not have the required permissions, the API will not be able to fetch posts. You need to make sure that the token has the necessary permissions.
- The API version is not supported: Facebook frequently updates its API, and older versions may not be supported. If the API version you are using is not supported, the API will not be able to fetch posts. You need to make sure that you are using a supported API version.
- The API rate limit is reached: Facebook API has a rate limit, which limits the number of requests that can be made in a specific time period. If the rate limit is reached, the API will not be able to fetch posts. You need to wait for some time or optimize your requests to avoid hitting the rate limit.
- The module configuration is incorrect: If the module configuration is incorrect, the API will not be able to fetch posts. You need to make sure that the module configuration is correct and all the necessary parameters are set up correctly.

### API Token expired

The module has an automatic refresh token function, which means that it can automatically refresh the access token for the API when it is about to expire.

One important thing to note is that the access token will be refreshed automatically only when Joomla cache is cleaned, and it is necessary to have a valid and working refresh token saved in the module settings. The refresh token is used to obtain a new access token when the old one is about to expire. If the refresh token is not valid or has expired, then the access token will not be refreshed automatically.
